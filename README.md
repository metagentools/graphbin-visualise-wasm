# GraphBin `visualise` WASM

A **browser-based interactive visualisation tool** for comparing **initial metagenomic binning results** and **[GraphBin](https://github.com/metagentools/GraphBin)-refined binning results** on assembly graphs, including static plots, a fully interactive assembly graph view, and a Sankey diagram summarising contig reassignment between binning results.


This project uses Pyodide (Python compiled to WebAssembly) to run `igraph`, GraphBin’s graph visualisation code, and the plotting code entirely in the browser — no backend needed.

## Web App (Anyone can use)

🌐 Live demo:
[metagentools.github.io/graphbin-visualise-wasm/](https://metagentools.github.io/graphbin-visualise-wasm/)

No installation needed! Python **not required**. Node.js **not required**. You only need a modern browser such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari or Edge.

## Features

### Static Graph Plots

* Run GraphBin plotting fully in the browser using WebAssembly
* Supports SPAdes assembler layout (GFA, contigs FASTA, contig paths)
* Upload initial binning and GraphBin-refined binning results
* Adjustable plot settings:
  * DPI
  * Width / height
  * Vertex size
  * Label size
  * Image type
* Automatically renders:
  * Initial binning plot
  * GraphBin-refined binning plot
* Download generated plots

### Interactive Assembly Graph Visualisation

* Interactive assembly graph with binning results
* Hover tooltips per contig showing:
  * Contig ID
  * Length
  * GC content
  * Coverage
  * Degree
  * Bin assignments
* Zoom, pan, and explore complex graphs visually
* Toggle visibility of bins and contigs
* Designed for exploratory analysis and quality assessment

### Binning Comparison Sankey Diagram

* Sankey diagram showing how contigs move between:
  * Initial binning results
  * GraphBin-refined binning results
* Each flow represents the number of contigs transferred between bins
* Unbinned contigs are shown explicitly (light grey) to highlight recovery or loss
* Supports interactive exploration:
  * Hover to inspect contig flow between specific bins
  * Click to lock/highlight a bin-to-bin transition
* Filters to:
  * Show only contigs that changed bin
  * Hide unbinned contigs
* Automatically updates when new binning results are plotted

This view provides a high-level summary of bin refinement behavior, complementing the detailed interactive assembly graph.


### General

* Built-in test data for instant demonstration
* Client-side file handling - your data never leaves your computer
* Pure static site — works on GitHub Pages


## Technologies Used

* Pyodide (Python → WebAssembly)
* igraph (graph processing + plotting)
* matplotlib (Pyodide backend) for static image generation
* React (UI framework)
* Vite (build tooling)
* JavaScript (ES6) application logic
* D3.js (Sankey + zoom interactions)
* Canvas API (interactive network rendering)
* HTML5/CSS3 user interface
* [GraphBin plotting logic](https://github.com/metagentools/GraphBin/tree/develop/src/graphbin/support)

## Running the App Locally (Advanced)

Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/metagentools/graphbin-visualise-wasm.git
cd graphbin-visualise-wasm
```

Because the browser cannot fetch local files with `file:///`, you must serve it with a lightweight local server. You will need Python for this step.

```shell
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then copy and paste the following link in your web browser.
```shell
http://localhost:8000
```
